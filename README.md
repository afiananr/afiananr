### Hi Folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="20px" height="20px"> I'm Afiana.

An undergraduate student majoring in Information System. Used to be into UI/UX stuff... until life threw Kotlin and Laravel at me. Now I design buttons and develop them until i cry ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­.
#### âš¡ Fun facts:
- Currently in a love-hate relationship with frontend
- I prefer light mode on VSCode â€” my friends literally complained about his eye damage while looking at my monitor. lmao
- Most productive between 11 PM and 4 AM. Basically a night owl with Wi-Fi.
